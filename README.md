Watch and Code course - https://watchandcode.com/

This is a free introductory course to javascript but it's a bit different to other courses out there. Rather than showing lists of language features and isolated tips and tricks, right from the get go you are shown what you need to know in order to build real world applications. The first example is a TODO list, an example used by many languages and frameworks. Even though this course uses javascript it's more about learning how to learn rather than being language specific which becomes apparent as you work through the course.

The course uses online text editors Plunker and Glitch but as I'm already familiar with Vim and wanted to use that, I've done that here. This is my 2nd run through of the course and did use Plunker and Glitch on my first run through. I also wanted to track my changes through Git especially as the course is split into versions. I'm doing a 2nd run through just for review and to reinforce my knowledge and learning. There are many things I think I know but can I use those things in project when I need them? How well do I really know them?

The initial commit starts from Version 4 in the course.
